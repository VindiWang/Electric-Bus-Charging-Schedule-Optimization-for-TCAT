Electric-Bus-Charging-Schedule-Optimization-for-TCAT

This project aims to design and implement an energy optimization model for the electric bus fleet of Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) using their General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The project integrates route scheduling, bus energy consumption modeling, and charging infrastructure constraints to minimize total charging cost while maintaining service reliability. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed using Gurobi to determine optimal charging schedules across multiple stations. By combining GTFS trip schedules and bus block data, the model dynamically allocates charging windows based on trip distances and time-of-day electricity pricing. The expected outcome is a practical optimization framework that supports TCAT’s electrification transition by reducing operational costs and improving charging station utilization efficiency.
